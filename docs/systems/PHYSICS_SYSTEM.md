## Physics Simulation

### Movement Integration
Handles the continuous update of entity positions based on their velocity and acceleration. Uses numerical integration methods to provide smooth, realistic movement that responds predictably to forces and constraints.

### Force Management
Implements force accumulation and application, allowing multiple forces to affect entities simultaneously. Supports different types of forces including gravity, thrust, drag, and custom game-specific forces.

### Material Properties
Simulates physical material characteristics that affect how entities interact. Includes properties like bounciness, friction, and density that determine collision behavior and energy transfer.

## Collision Detection

### Broad Phase Optimization
Initial filtering mechanism that quickly identifies potentially colliding entity pairs. Uses spatial partitioning techniques to reduce the number of detailed collision checks required.

### Narrow Phase Detection
Precise collision detection for entity pairs identified in the broad phase. Supports multiple collision shapes and provides detailed information about collision points, normals, and penetration depth.

### Collision Response
Determines how entities behave when they collide. Implements realistic physics responses including momentum transfer, energy loss, and constraint enforcement.

## Performance Optimization

### Spatial Partitioning
Divides the game world into regions to efficiently locate nearby entities. Enables fast queries for collision detection and neighbor finding while maintaining performance with large numbers of entities.

### Simulation Islands
Groups connected entities into simulation units that can be processed independently. Allows parallel processing of physics simulation and reduces computational overhead.

### Level of Detail
Adjusts physics simulation complexity based on entity importance and distance. Provides full physics for player-relevant entities while simplifying distant or less important objects.

## Integration Strategy

### ECS Integration
- Reads position, velocity, and acceleration components

## Advanced Features

### Joints and Constraints
Connects entities with physical relationships that constrain their movement. Supports hinges, springs, and other connection types for complex physical structures.

### Raycasting and Queries
Provides line-of-sight testing and spatial queries for gameplay mechanics. Enables features like projectile collision, visibility testing, and interaction detection.

### Soft Body Simulation
Supports deformable objects that respond realistically to forces. Enables dynamic object deformation and flexible material behavior.
