# Rendering System

## System Overview

The Rendering System manages all visual output for the game, including sprite rendering, camera management, and visual effects. It operates as an independent graphics pipeline that transforms game state into visual representation.

## Core Purpose

The rendering system exists to:
- Provide efficient visual representation of game entities
- Manage camera systems for different viewing perspectives
- Handle layered rendering for depth and organization
- Support visual effects and animations
- Maintain consistent visual quality across different hardware

## System Scope

### Primary Responsibilities
- Entity sprite rendering with position and orientation
- Camera management and viewport control
- Layered rendering system for visual depth
- Animation frame management and timing
- Visual effect processing and composition
- Performance optimization for rendering operations

### Integration Points
- ECS provides position, renderable, and animation component data
- Physics system supplies accurate position information
- Resource system provides texture and sprite assets
- UI system handles interface rendering
- Event system communicates rendering state changes

## Rendering Pipeline

### Entity Rendering
Processes all visual entities in the game world, applying transformations, animations, and visual effects. Handles sprite rendering with support for scaling, rotation, and color modification.

### Camera System
Manages different camera perspectives and viewport configurations. Supports multiple cameras for split-screen, mini-maps, and special effects. Handles camera following, zooming, and smooth transitions.

### Layer Management
Organizes visual elements by depth and rendering order. Ensures proper draw ordering for sprites, effects, and UI elements. Supports dynamic layer assignment and sorting.

## Visual Effects

### Animation System
Manages sprite animations with frame timing and sequencing. Supports different animation types including looping, one-shot, and ping-pong animations. Handles animation state transitions and blending.

### Particle Effects
Provides particle system support for dynamic visual effects. Manages particle emission, movement, and rendering with support for different particle types and behaviors.

### Post-Processing
Applies visual effects to the entire rendered scene. Includes effects like bloom, color grading, and screen space ambient occlusion for enhanced visual quality.

## Performance Optimization

### Batching System
Groups similar rendering operations to reduce draw calls. Combines sprites with the same texture and properties into efficient batch operations.

### Culling Mechanisms
Filters out objects outside the camera view or occluded by other objects. Reduces rendering workload by only processing visible elements.

### Level of Detail
Adjusts rendering complexity based on distance and importance. Provides simplified rendering for distant objects while maintaining detail for important elements.

## Graphics Abstraction

### Backend Independence
Provides abstraction layer over different graphics APIs. Supports multiple rendering backends while maintaining consistent interface for game systems.

### Resource Management
Coordinates with resource system for texture loading and management. Handles texture streaming, compression, and memory management for optimal performance.

### Shader System
Manages shader programs for different rendering effects. Provides shader compilation, parameter management, and effect coordination.

## Integration Strategy

### ECS Integration
- Reads position and renderable components for entity rendering
- Updates animation components based on timing
- Manages camera component state
- Provides rendering-related events

### System Coordination
- Receives entity updates from physics system
- Provides visual feedback for input system
- Shares resources with audio system for spatial effects
- Communicates with UI system for overlay rendering

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Pass Rendering
Supports multiple rendering passes for complex effects. Enables advanced techniques like deferred rendering and multi-layer compositing.

### Dynamic Lighting
Provides dynamic lighting calculations and shadow rendering. Supports different light types and lighting models for realistic illumination.

### Material System
Manages material properties and shader assignments. Supports different material types with unique visual characteristics and rendering requirements.

## Success Criteria
