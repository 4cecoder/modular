## System Relationships

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Input System → Physics System → Rendering System
     ↓              ↓              ↓
   UI System → Event System → Audio System
     ↓              ↓              ↓
Resource System → Plugin System → AI System
```

### Communication Patterns

#### Direct Component Access
- Systems read/write ECS components directly
- Immediate data synchronization
- Used for high-frequency updates (physics, rendering)

#### Event-Driven Communication
- Systems publish events for state changes
- Asynchronous message processing
- Used for discrete events (collisions, input actions)

#### Resource Sharing
- Systems access shared resources through resource manager
- Cached resource access with lifecycle management
- Used for assets and configuration data

## Performance Architecture

### Execution Model
- **Frame-based**: Systems execute in sequence each frame
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent systems run concurrently
- **Priority-based**: Critical systems execute first
- **Load Balancing**: Work distributed across available CPU cores

### Memory Management
- **Component Storage**: Contiguous memory for cache efficiency
- **Resource Pooling**: Reuse of expensive resources
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic cleanup of unused resources
- **Memory Budgeting**: Per-system memory limits and monitoring

### Optimization Strategies
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Efficient queries for nearby entities
- **Level of Detail**: Reduced processing for distant/irrelevant entities
- **Batching**: Group similar operations for efficiency
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data in fast memory

## Integration Patterns

### System Initialization
1. ECS initializes core component storage
2. Resource system loads essential assets
3. Each system registers components and resources
4. Event system establishes communication channels
5. Plugin system loads and initializes extensions

### Runtime Execution
1. Input system polls devices and updates state
2. AI system processes entity decisions
3. Physics system updates positions and handles collisions
4. Rendering system draws current frame
5. Audio system processes spatial sound
6. UI system handles interface updates

### Shutdown Process
1. Plugin system unloads extensions
2. Event system flushes pending messages
3. Resource system unloads assets
4. Each system cleans up resources
5. ECS destroys remaining entities

## Modularity Benefits
