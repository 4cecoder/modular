### Composition Over Inheritance
- Systems are composed rather than extended
- Components define behavior through composition
- Flexible entity construction
- Runtime system configuration

### Event-Driven Communication
- Systems communicate through events
- Loose coupling between components
- Asynchronous message passing
- Extensible event system

### Performance-First Design
- Cache-friendly data structures
- Parallel system execution
- Efficient memory management
- Scalable algorithms

### System Relationships
```
Input → Physics → Rendering
   ↓      ↓        ↓
  UI → Events → Audio
   ↓      ↓        ↓
Resources → Plugins → AI
```
